Welcome to FRC-Abacus!

This was an eliminations-tracking app designed for the 2013 IRI specifically (which is [live on the Google Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=szechy.abacus)), and then designed to be more extendable for the 2014 FRC season, and beyond. Unfortunately, I lost interest and time - I wasn't sure of demand for a niche FRC app like this, and I found other things I wanted to work on. Here it is, presented for the world (for if it can be any use).
